                    <p>
                        Apart from the normal wear and tear, both parties—the tenants and the owners—are 
                        jointly responsible for the maintenance of the property, unless the agreement specifies
                        different conditions. For example, as a tenant, you cannot pull down a wall, 
                        or as the owner, you cannot renovate the premises unless agreed upon by both parties.
                        In the case that the tenants refuse to pay for the repairs, the amount can be deducted
                        from their security deposit and if the owners refuse to pay, the amount can be 
                        deducted from the periodic rent. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the tenants occupy the house, they are responsible for maintaining the original
                        conditions (again, except for the minimal, normal wear and tear). They cannot 
                        intentionally or negligently damage the property and if in the cases that such 
                        damage does occur, they must notify the owner immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tenants may be asked to vacate the premises if they fail to pay their full rent for 
                        two consecutive months.In addition to this, if the tenants have parted ways with 
                        the property (for an extended period of time) without a written notice or if they 
                        are encroaching upon additional property or misusing it (so as to cause public nuisance,
                        for illegal activities) or damaging it, they can be lawfully asked to evacuate the 
                        premises.If the tenants fail to do so within the specified time, the landowner 
                        is entitled to double the monthly rent as compensation.
